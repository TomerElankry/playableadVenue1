## 🧪 Testing Checklist

Before sharing, make sure:
- ✅ Intro screen loads
- ✅ "Start Design" button works
- ✅ Hotspots are clickable
- ✅ Catalog opens and items can be selected
- ✅ Progress counter updates (x/6)
- ✅ Final screen appears with "PLAY" button
- ✅ Works on mobile (test in Chrome DevTools mobile view)
- ⚠️ Audio won't play in AppLovin version (expected)

---

## 🔧 Build Scripts (For Future Updates)

If you make changes to `index.html` and need to rebuild the AppLovin version:

```bash
# Optimized version (recommended)
python3 build_applovin_optimized.py

# Full version with all assets
python3 build_applovin_full.py
```

---

## 📝 Notes

- **Original files are untouched** - Your `index.html` and `assets/` are preserved
- **Audio removed in AppLovin version** - Saves 2MB, most ad networks don't need it
- **Catalog items load externally** - Make sure to upload the `assets/` folder with the HTML
